I'll create a simple 3D game using Fyrox! This will be a basic "Player Movement" game where you control a character that can move around a simple environment.Now let me create the `Cargo.toml` file that goes with this game:And here's a README file to explain the game:I've created a complete simple 3D game using Fyrox! Here's what you get:

## 🎮 **Simple Player Movement Game**

**Features:**
- **Blue cube player** controlled with WASD keys
- **Third-person camera** that smoothly follows the player
- **3D environment** with a green ground plane and orange cube obstacles
- **Smooth movement** with proper delta-time handling
- **Directional lighting** for realistic 3D rendering

## 📁 **Complete Project Files**

1. **Game Code** (`src/main.rs`) - The complete game implementation
2. **Dependencies** (`Cargo.toml`) - Proper Fyrox setup with optimizations  
3. **Documentation** (`README.md`) - Comprehensive guide and learning resource

## 🚀 **How to Run**

```bash
# Create new project
cargo new simple-fyrox-game --bin
cd simple-fyrox-game

# Copy the provided files, then run:
cargo run
```

## 🎯 **What You'll Learn**

This game demonstrates core Fyrox concepts:
- **Scene Management**: Creating 3D scenes with multiple objects
- **Input Handling**: Processing keyboard input for player movement
- **Camera Systems**: Implementing smooth follow cameras
- **Materials & Rendering**: Creating colored 3D objects
- **Game Loop Architecture**: Proper update/render cycle with delta time

## 🔧 **Easy to Extend**

The code is structured to make it easy to add:
- **Collision detection** with obstacles
- **Jumping mechanics** with gravity
- **Score systems** and collectibles
- **Enemy AI** and game objectives
- **Sound effects** and particle systems

## 🎨 **Visual Description**

- **Player**: Bright blue cube that you control
- **Environment**: Green ground plane (20x20 units)
- **Obstacles**: Orange cubes scattered around the scene
- **Camera**: Third-person view that follows behind and above
- **Sky**: Light blue background color

The game creates a simple but engaging 3D world perfect for learning Fyrox fundamentals and serves as a great starting point for more complex games!

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the code or help you add additional features?
